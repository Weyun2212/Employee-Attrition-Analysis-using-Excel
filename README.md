# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-using-Excel
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data within an organization using Excel. The objective is to understand the factors driving employee turnover, identify trends in attrition, and uncover insights that HR professionals and management can use to improve retention strategies.

📊 Project Overview

Employee attrition, or turnover, is a major challenge for organizations as it increases hiring costs, reduces productivity, and impacts team morale.
This project analyzes a structured attrition dataset to answer questions such as:

- Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition?

- How do age, gender, education, and marital status affect turnover?

- Does job satisfaction or work environment satisfaction influence attrition?

- Are salary hikes helping to retain employees?

- Which groups of employees are most at risk of leaving?

This Excel project provides a clear and comprehensive view of these factors through dashboards and visualizations.

🛠️ Data Preparation

Before analysis, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing:

- Standardized and cleaned column names

- Handled missing and inconsistent values

- Converted date fields and categorical values into correct data types

- Created calculated fields such as tenure and satisfaction groupings

- Filtered active vs. inactive employees

- Validated performance ratings and job role categories

These steps ensured accurate and reliable insights throughout the analysis.

📈 Key Dashboard Insights

1. Job & Organizational Factors

- Highest attrition occurs in Sales, technical roles, and R&D-related job positions.

- Most employees who leave have less than 3 years of tenure.

- Bachelor’s degree holders show the highest turnover.

2. Work Experience & Satisfaction

- Low job satisfaction and low environment satisfaction strongly correlate with attrition.

- Employees working frequent overtime are significantly more likely to leave.

- Both average and high performers show attrition, indicating possible lack of recognition or growth.

3. Demographic Factors

- Employees aged 25–34 have the highest attrition rate.

- Single employees leave more frequently than married employees.

- Shorter commute distances do not reduce attrition, indicating workplace rather than commuting issues.

- Attrition is higher among male employees in this dataset.

4. Compensation

- Employees in the low income band show the highest attrition.

- Salary hike percentage does not significantly influence retention.

📌 At-Risk Employee Groups

- Employees with low job or environment satisfaction

- Actively listen to employee feedback and improve workplace environment

- Reduce overtime pressure or compensate employees fairly

- Provide clearer growth, training, and development opportunities

- Revisit compensation strategy to support lower income bands

- Support early-tenure employees through mentorship and onboarding programs

📂 Project Deliverables
